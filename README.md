# What is listwalk?
Although the name doesn't say it all, listwalk is a simple, yet genious, way of discovering new music on Spotify. What it does is that it generates a playlist on Spotify based on one single term - a word! So for instance, searching for **'love'** will result into a playlist of 45 songs. All from different genres and artists that only share one thing in common; they either include the word **'love'** in their track, artist or album name. Above that, only song that have a popularity level higher than 50 are taken into account. The result: a playlist with songs you perhaps never heard of before.

## Requirements

1. Spotify (well you will need an account in order to listen to the lovely playlists that are generated)
2. Ruby on Rails 4 running on Ruby 2
3. [RSpotify](https://github.com/guilhermesad/rspotify) gem for Ruby on Rails
